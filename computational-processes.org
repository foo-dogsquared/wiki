#+TITLE: Computational processes

Just as a sorcerer needs spells, a programmer needs code to do its bidding.
Simple processes such as designing models with computer-aided design programs and controlling a robot arm in a factory are possible through expressing in code.

In order to study the idea of how code works, we need to study the idea of computational processes.
Programming mainly need two things: *processes* which is a set of instructions and *data* which is the object being manipulated for various purposes.
