[[https://nixos.org/][Nix]] is a package manager that pioneered [[file:2020-09-19-08-31-48.org][Functional package management]] which addresses the criticisms of traditional Unix systems while making it as a specialized tool for [[file:2020-04-12-11-20-53.org][Reproducible research]].
Holistically, Nix is made up of at least four components: the store, the language, the derivations, and the sandbox.

- The store is a immutable centralized location where all of the outputs are placed.
- The derivations are essentially build instructions.
- The language (also called as Nix but we'll refer to it as Nixlang) is a domain-specific language for creating derivations.
- The build process can be locked in a sandbox, improving the reproducibility of a setup and lowering the attack surface for a malicious package.
