You see graphic design being used everywhere including in websites, movie posters, books (covers and everything), chocolate boxes, and glass cases.
The common ground between the listed items are about presenting an idea or a product.
Some of the designs revolve around text (e.g., typography), shapely forms (e.g., visual design), and composition (e.g., web design) which then may be used exclusively or any of the combination.
