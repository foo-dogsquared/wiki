#+end_quote

- coined by Steven Pinker from his book, "The sense of style"
- focuses on an unrelated thing of your study or activity
- some examples
  + in film, instead of focusing what movie is about, they boast about the sales or views
  + in media, "cover the coverage", a problem leading to echo chambers
  + in learning, instead of focusing what and why of a note-taking method, they focus on the possible effects of your productivity
- this could also happen on yourself
  + in note-taking, you may focus on the number of notes instead of the quality of each notes
  + in programming, you may boast how the program is fast instead of making sure the program is usable
