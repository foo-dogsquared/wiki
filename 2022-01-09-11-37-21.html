This includes tutorials with a solid-end goal.
</p><p>Consider this idea with the following example:
</p><blockquote><p>A general purpose book that teaches you how to use Adobe Photoshop with information that is full to the brim but no solid examples versus a video tutorial that teaches how to create a cool-looking logo with Photoshop.
</p></blockquote><p>With this, the scenario for most people will most likely end up like the following:
</p><ul><li><p>The book will eventually teach us nothing as there&#x27;s no practical application to make use of our newly-learnt knowledge.
  (Though the practice could be effective by skimming the content.)
</p></li><li><p>While the video tutorial is specific, we have taught how to make use of several things in one intertwined way.
  The video example may showcase workflows that gives you more ideas how a thing work.
</p></li></ul><p>In most cases, we&#x27;ll end up more informed with the video tutorial as most of us <a href="/wiki/2021-06-21-10-08-01">Start with wishful thinking</a> when <a href="/wiki/2021-07-09-19-20-50">Skill-building</a>.
Furthermore, a lot of the example-specific tutorials subtly showcases two or more information.
As you learn how to recreate the tutorial, you&#x27;ll gather more ideas.
You have the prerequisites to understand and transfer those skills into another project.
Going back with the Photoshop video tutorial example, you now have learnt several things such as how to create shapes, apply gradients, and masking which is useful for other projects.
</p><p>It is sometimes better to know how to accomplish something without knowing how it works.
You can always look into it later and to prevent <a href="/wiki/learning.pitfalls.overlearning">Overlearning</a>.
<a href="/wiki/2021-07-15-07-47-32">When starting out, focus on quantity over quality</a> as you can create more ideas while following more tutorials.
</p><p>Even more specific, you can look into how others do such thing.
<a href="/wiki/2021-05-05-19-43-14">Look for live sessions as another form of examples</a> and <a href="/wiki/2021-07-22-14-01-10">Communicate with others to learn</a>.
