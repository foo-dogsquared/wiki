#+TITLE: Maintaining a digital library
#+ROAM_TAGS: pim


Having your own digital library can be one of the most valuable thing for your life.
It is flexible in purpose: you can use it as a personal knowledge base, digital novelties collection, and/or project repository.
With all things personal, [[file:personal-information-management.org][expect it you should be familiar with a little bit of personal information management]] stuff.

A digital library should have the following features:

- Easy to maintain which is the top priority.
- Catalog the files using open standardized tools and specifications if available.
- Provide an easy and reliable search interface with rich metadata.

Instituition libraries such as Internet Archive and ArXiv have are the go-to examples for a long sustaining digital library.
Personal digital libraries are basically personal information management systems where your resources are stored: documents, notes, references, and media files.

I have been thinking of creating a digital library for myself.
These are the tools I've been using for my experiment:

- Zotero as my reference management library.
- Exiftool for annotating my files with metadata.
- Recoll as the search interface.
- Org-Mode with org-roam as my personal wiki/knowledge base and my go-to quick note-taking tool.

There are a couple of minor things such as Buku as my bookmarks manager, lf as a file explorer, mpv for multimedia, and Firefox as my web browser.

My digital library are fragmented with each component located in its own directory (e.g., Zotero data directory is in ~$HOME/Documents/references~, books and documents are at ~$HOME/Documents/books~, wiki at ~$HOME/writings/wiki~) but it is a non-problem for me and it is easy to solve if it's a problem.
