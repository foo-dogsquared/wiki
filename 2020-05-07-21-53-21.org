Just like how books are not published from first draft, notes should have the same process.
With this in mind, evergreen notes should have the following properties:

- It is atomic.
- It enables you to develop further insight.
- As you develop more evergreen notes, more time is put on editing them rather than creating them.

To start writing an evergreen note, you could start with your [[id:3d1c0313-fa3d-4b18-b435-51d3837e3e2c][Fleeting notes]] and outline the main ideas.
An evergreen note does not have to be finished within one sitting.
In fact, it is preferred to build it incrementally, editing the note as you go developing insights.
(It is previously mentioned that evergreen notes should be taken with you, after all.)
