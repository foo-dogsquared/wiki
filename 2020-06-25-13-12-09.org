Fleeting notes are a valuable scratchpad for our messy thoughts â€” it's natural to have a messy input since they are catered only to yourself.

You could search through them with various search techniques to quickly retrieve them (see [[file:2020-06-27-16-21-47.org][Apply search tools and techniques for your digital library]]).
