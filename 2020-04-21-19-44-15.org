As previously stated, [[file:2020-04-20-16-51-40.org][Org-mode]] is first created as an outliner enabling you to manage tasks.
Here's some of the features you might be interested when using it as such.




* Repeated tasks

Org-mode features [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Repeated-tasks.html][repeated tasks]] and it looks like the following.

#+begin_src org  :results silent
SCHEDULED: <2020-06-22 Mon +2d>
#+end_src

Any missed session will cause the agenda to keep overdued sessions and accumulate to repeat the tasks 'X' number of times with the number of overdued sessions.

Some tasks does not work this way, however.
You don't need to replace the batteries 5 times or brush your teeth 10 times to make up for it.
For this, you can do the following.

#+begin_src org  :results silent
SCHEDULED: <2020-06-22 Mon ++2d>
#+end_src

One cool thing about it if you mark a task as done, it will simply create an entry of the task completed and update the base date.

#+begin_src org  :results silent
\* TODO Watch the lectures from Brian Harvey's SICP series (https://archive.org/details/ucberkeley-webcast-PL3E89002AA9B9879E?sort=titleSorter)
SCHEDULED: <2020-06-24 Wed .+2d>
:PROPERTIES:
:LAST_REPEAT: [2020-06-22 Mon 22:01]
:END:
- State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2020-06-22 Mon 22:01]
#+end_src

This will also integrate with certain features like the agenda views.
You can see future entries along with the number of times you have to do to make up for the missed sessions.
