Bookkeeping is the practice of tracking and classifying various financial moves.
</p><p>Bookkeeping can make financial management less stressful (and some might say, enjoyable).
You can easily know what you have: disposable income, loans, credits, etc.
On the other hand, it is also legally required for business to keep track of it.
</p><p>In accounting, the basic unit of operations are <strong>transactions</strong>.
Transactions are seen everywhere — you&#x27;ve done a transaction when you&#x27;ve bought your laptop, ordered some food, delivered a package, etc.
</p><p>To make a transaction, an <strong>account</strong> is used as a marker or label for the two sides.
For example, a transaction for buying a laptop with cash is made of two accounts for the cash and the laptop.
</p><p>In personal financing, there are said five common accounts:
</p><ul><li><p>Assets which are composed of your bank account, wallet, real estate, and investments.
</p></li><li><p>Liabilities which is something you owe (e.g., mortgages, loans).
</p></li><li><p>Income, another term for revenue, is your paychecks, received gifts, and interests.
</p></li><li><p>Expenses including groceries and bills, given gifts, and donations.
</p></li><li><p>Equity is everything else.
</p></li></ul><p>Each transaction is made up of two components usually referred as <strong>debit</strong> and <strong>credits</strong>.
