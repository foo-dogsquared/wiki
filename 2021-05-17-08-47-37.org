While [[id:114b7874-6a20-49c8-be2c-46970c7110dc][Information is only acquired when you try to make sense of it]], we just know more compared to what we understood.
It doesn't mean it's a bad thing as [[id:c0e4fb0e-68f2-4db4-8c3e-f5a7845738c3][Understanding comes first from memory]].
The amount of things is too great that deserve our limited attention.

- we can still make sense since we are more associative than structured
- the skill of referencing through can help starting to understand
- note-taking can help increase
