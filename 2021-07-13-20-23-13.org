- each options have its advantages and disadvantages
- [[id:d885e93b-f919-4338-a6b9-3438538e18c0][Every copy of the techniques is personalized]];
  choose what you're comfortable with or make a [[id:9b669fd4-e04e-43dd-a61e-81dea5ec0764][Deliberate practice]] with setting a new level (or a new perspective)
- examples:
  + learning a new skill versus improving your specialization at one time
  + using one tool versus another locking yourself inside of the tool â€” e.g., Emacs versus Vim versus Visual Studio Code
  + using the bare minimal of a feature set versus using it to the full potential
- no matter what, you're locking yourself in a position but both have risks
  + learning a new skill can make for a better skill set and it makes for a little interleaving while digging deeper into a specialization can make in-depth knowledge;
    both have risks: vulnerability to changes rendering the time you spent for a specialization to be nearly useless, not making yourself more attractive to the job market with more specialized skills
  + locking oneself to the text editor can mean taking advantage of the already existing ecosystem of the text editors
  + using the bare minimum of a feature set prevents you to do other things but it also minimizes the problems for future migrations to other tools
- that said, balancing tradeoffs is a matter of creativity to suit your ideal workflow with the things you have;
  just be beware of going into overanalyzing as [[id:b62c61f1-ee12-4bd9-b59a-ec6eafe29f38][Unnecessary optimizations cripple progress]]
