- the main command is =:h= which should open =help.txt= if given no arguments;
  this should be enough if you want to explore much of Neovim itself as the document has an index of tutorials and local additions (most likely from the installed plugins)
- the help documents are written in a custom formatting language that is recognized as a separate filetype;
  in addition to navigating the buffer like any other buffer, you can also run =gO= to show the table of contents
- if given an argument, Vim will open the section of the document with the closest match
- some points of interest
  - you can view the complete listing of help tags with =help-tags=
  - there is also a index of tags from =index.txt=
  - you can easily get the keybind with =CTRL-V= (e.g., =CTRL-V= then =META-D= will quickly print the keymap)
  - tab completion is present
