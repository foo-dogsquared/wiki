The internet is a place full of information.
In fact, too full.

You could consume endless information from one resource to another and create stagnation because you're adapting too many ideas at a time.
It could further your hoarding tendencies and maybe just start collecting knowledge.

Having a roadmap helps you to stay on track whether you're studying for a job, creating a new project, or learning a new hobby.
This roadmap could be just a simple to-do list, an elaborate plan, or a one-line description of the output you expect [fn:: This is still a terrible example but it should eventually evolve into details.].
