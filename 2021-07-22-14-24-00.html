Self-learning amplifies this purposeful sense but it is more strict in requirement.
</p><p>It is purposeful in the sense that our learnt lessons will be put to use.
E.g., learning <a href="/wiki/2020-12-26-13-30-39">Illustration</a> for the self-expression, make beautiful landscapes, or create the series you&#x27;ve been dreaming about.
Or you could learn foreign languages because you found a job from abroad that requires you to communicate with others.
</p><p>Teaching others is an art and a science dealing with the individuality of the students.
Self-teaching is you dealing with your individuality.
In a sense, self-learning is more about responsibility than learning in isolation.
</p><p>It needs more self-control and self-reflection: the ability to criticize yourself constructively, evaluating and correcting those mistakes.
You need to apply the <a href="/wiki/2021-07-22-14-02-06">Learning techniques</a> for yourself while looking out how you&#x27;re doing.
</p><p>Self-learning shouldn&#x27;t be taken in a literal sense (see <a href="/wiki/2021-07-04-15-36-22">Advice shouldn&#x27;t be taken literally</a>).
Learning in isolation is not a good way to learn either especially that you&#x27;ll be lacking feedback, one of the most important component for learning.
You cannot simply have a basis for how far you&#x27;ve reached with <a href="/wiki/2020-07-06-23-55-47">Deliberate practice</a> when you don&#x27;t have others to compare.
<a href="/wiki/2021-07-22-14-01-10">Communicate with others to learn</a>.
