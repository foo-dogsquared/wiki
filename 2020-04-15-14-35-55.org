Note-taking does not only involve the act of writing but also the act of retrieval from finding contextual relationships from two notes, separating notes into digestible chunks, and searching notes effectively.

The reason why you may want to do note-taking is to write all of the thoughts down so you don't have to remember.

There are different ways of note-taking.
Among the endless list of methods, popular methods include [[id:4259636e-e0e8-49e4-8210-758ec59728a3][Zettelkasten]], [[id:24b5e144-dda4-482c-9684-958a00d6c986][Roam Research]], Cornell method, or the traditional [[id:d3fbdb1a-9629-45ef-9f08-32c6e49025bb][Linear notes]].

Not all note-taking is the formal method of paraphrasing our observations and thoughts, this can also be a method of merely writing our thoughts down.
