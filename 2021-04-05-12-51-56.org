The act of reading faster than the average speed.
One of the common methods in shutting off your inner reading voice and replacing it with visualizing words as you read along.

To understand why the surrounding skepticism, we have to look at the claims especially with anything that involves more than 1,000 words per minute (WPM) of reading speed.
Knowing [[file:2021-05-02-23-05-42.org][The basics of memory]], this is neurologically unlikely as learning takes time.
Speedreading is also physically impossible as reading is a complex process.
It takes time to absorb even an inch of information compared to the very fast pace of merely reading the material at double the average speed of 300 WPM.

As I dive deeper into this topic, the more it appears that it is basically skimming with a fancier name.
Thus, speedreading can be a great way to improve comprehension if one ought to think that [[file:2021-04-05-12-43-36.org][Speedreading is all about skimming well]].
