We are tricking ourselves, falling into one of the [[id:9dc7cb08-3aea-4f66-80ac-49a14b4b7642][Pitfalls and illusions of competence]] with the presence of the material making us feel like we already know the subject.
The keyword here is *feels like progress*.
The most important thing you should know when finding yourself with this tendency is information is only stored, not consumed.
[[id:114b7874-6a20-49c8-be2c-46970c7110dc][Information is only acquired when you try to make sense of it]].

Nonetheless, it is still useful if we can control our resource-collecting tendencies.
One of the simplest ways to reduce this is to [[id:810dc8b6-db64-4c80-a0aa-f9e6d5fa4acf][Create an inbox to store your thoughts]].
Or rather, an inbox of resources that you'll have to filter later.
