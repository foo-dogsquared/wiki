The learning process is not perfect and just like everything else in life, there are some traps that you could step in.
This could cost you either time or forming bad habits that require unlearning later.

The following is an exhaustive list of things to look out for.

- The [[id:9986bd9e-763e-497e-a35d-ecd0aa93f408][Presence of the material fools students into learning]].
- [[id:9138397a-a965-45e9-97ea-71849e8d4f94][Overlearning]] is a habitual problem of students, thinking they should master the concept holistically before moving on to other topics.
- [[id:5c603e2c-4dae-465e-abb5-12897ad7466d][Tunnel vision]]: learning new things can be impeded from our own experience.
- Working with solutions can be a trap if you focus solely on the steps.
