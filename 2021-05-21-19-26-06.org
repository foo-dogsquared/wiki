The learning process is not perfect and just like everything else in life, there are some traps that you could step in.
This could cost you either time or forming bad habits that require unlearning later.

The following is an exhaustive list of things to look out for.

- The presence of the material itself can fool the student thinking they already know the material.
  + Solution: close the material and practice self-testing.
- Overlearning: tackling the material for complete mastery for the nth time
  + Solution: simply move on once you already know the basics of the concept.
  + Remember [[id:df20e58b-6d38-4ace-8468-413bc708c772][Most of the work is done from smaller amount of effort]].
- Being invested in an idea that you cannot see other solutions.
  + Solution: do some occasional workshopping with related concepts or tools.
  + This is the reason why most of the discoveries are made either by young people or those who haven't formally trained or studied for the original field.
- Working with solutions can be a trap if you focus solely on the steps.
  + Solution: give time to focus on the bigger picture.
  + Inversely, understanding without the memorization is still bad as [[id:c0e4fb0e-68f2-4db4-8c3e-f5a7845738c3][Understanding comes first from memory]].
