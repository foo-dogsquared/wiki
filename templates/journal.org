* Goals and expectations
# Put what you expect out of your journey as well as the expected time span to
# get to that part. For example, if you want to draw to the level of professionals
# in 10 months. Just like in most parts, be sure to put timestamps to be absolute
# with the ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).

* Resources, preparations, and execution
# This is where you list a bunch of resources you scouted, the materials and
# things that you need at some point in the future, and how to make your goals
# come true as previously mentioned from the Goals and expectations section.

* Habits and todos
# If you want to make some skill building, you can lay all of the habits and
# things you want to do in a solid tasklist. With the right configuration,
# org-agenda will include the things here.

* %<%Y-%m-%d>
# With the goals and plans laid out, you can now start your journalling starting
# today.
