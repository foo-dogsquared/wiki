[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Module_file][Module files]] (MOD) are simply MIDIs except with embedded soundfonts.
They are usually associated with the demoscene culture.
I mostly heard them from keygens which a [[http://www.keygenmusic.net/][website apparently collects]].
One of the biggest public archive for MOD files you can find is [[https://modarchive.org/][The Mod Archive]].

To play MOD files, you have to install a player like QMPlay2, MPD server with the =modplug= plugin installed, and mpv.
Some of the primary libraries to keep in mind when considering MOD files playback is [[https://lib.openmpt.org/][libopenmpt]] and libmodplug.

If you want to create MOD files, [[https://openmpt.org/][OpenMPT]] is a good primary choice.
Being a tracker, it could present different experience from a digital audio workstation (DAW) like Ardour, LMMS, Zrythm, and FL Studio.
