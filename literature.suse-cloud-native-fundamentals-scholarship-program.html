  Among the list of projects, they have Kubernetes and Docker.
</p></li><li><p>While cloud-native tools are widely adopted, you need to consider the stakeholders.
  From a business perspective, it needs to represent agility and growth.
  From a technical perspective, it needs to present automation and observability.
</p></li><li><p>Application architecture:
</p><ul><li><p>One way to construct an application is with the <strong>monolith structure where all of the components are stored in a monorepo</strong>.
</p></li><li><p>Another is through <strong>microservice architecture where each component can live in its own repository</strong>.

</p></li></ul><h1 id="lesson-3">Lesson 3</h1><ul><li><p>containers versus virtual machines
</p><ul><li><p>virtual machines are software that emulates the full stack of a computer including the operating system, applications, and hardware
</p></li><li><p>containers are similar to virtual machines except they have less components — e.g., there is no need for hardware emulation, the operating system is removed
</p></li><li><p>by their nature, containers are lightweight compared to virtual machines
</p></li><li><p>nowadays, both features make use of OS-level virtualization — e.g., chroot, FreeBSD jails, Linux containers (LXC)
</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Docker is one of the more popular platforms for containers;
  as a platform, it is composed of a daemon that has to be activated first before you can do container stuff and also hosts a <a href="https://hub.docker.com/">large library of images</a> to make as a foundation
</p></li><li><p>an application can be packaged with Docker images as a distribution method — e.g., <a href="https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox">ArchiveBox</a></p></li><li><p>container workflow: configuring what image to create, then build an image from the configuration (i.e., Dockerfile), run the image for testing purposes, tagging it, then pushing the image to a registry
</p></li><li><p>while managing containers is viable, you may have to manage a lot of containers;
  while possible, it does scale a lot for the developer;
  for this, you can use a container orchestrator
</p></li><li><p>among the list of orchestrators, we have Docker Swarm, Apache Mesos, and Kubernetes among others;
  but for this topic, we&#x27;ll go with Kubernetes as it is popular and also goes with the building blocks structure (a set of primitive blocks that can be customized to create more complex operations)
</p></li><li><p>Kubernetes manages several resources:
</p><ul><li><p>it manages a cluster, the entire group of nodes where each node (service or master)
</p></li><li><p>worker nodes is a group of pods
</p></li><li><p>pods are a group of containers
</p></li><li><p>deployments indicate the state of the pod
</p></li><li><p>replica sets ensure at least one similar pod is running at a time
</p></li><li><p>services
</p></li><li><p>ConfigMaps handles pod configurations
</p></li><li><p>namespaces provide separation of logic between different applications, that is, application context
</p></li></ul></li></ul><h1 id="lesson-4">Lesson 4</h1><ul><li><p>small organizations do not often have the resources to manage their own clusters thus often use third-party providers;
  while some organizations do have the resources, the scope to manage clusters often overshadow the team managing it
</p></li><li><p>in cases like those, it make sense to use Platform-as-a-Service platforms (PaaS)
</p></li><li><p>there are different components in a technology stack that an organization can manage:
  starting from servers, storage, virtualization, operating system, runtime, data, and application
</p></li><li><p>several providers are offering the above components and usually go into several umbrellas:
</p><ul><li><p>the organization can choose no provider and instead manage their own with their own hardware, infrastructure, and all;
    having an on-premises instance lets the organization full control of the whole stack but it can take a while to setup before the team can manage their deployments
</p></li><li><p>some organizations will choose a provider that offers a infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) — e.g., Google Cloud Platform, Amazon Web Services — just not providing a way to manage the hardware (e.g., servers, storage)
</p></li><li><p>others will choose platform-as-a-service (PaaS), reducing further what the organization can manage, only the application and the data
</p></li><li><p>some providers offer functions-as-a-service (FaaS) — e.g., Amazon Lambda, Netlify Lambda — that only invokes the application on-demand
</p></li></ul></li><li><p>the point is the more the organization has full control of, the more complexity the organization has to worry about;
  while they have full control over the stack, they have also to cover the full expense for managing it;
  having more control also means less chances of being vendor lock-in, thus, more flexibility with more options to add and remove features into the market
</p></li><li><p>the less components they have control over, the less complexity;
  with less things to worry about, it takes less time to create prototypes and less overall expenses;
  but since they delegate the tasks to a third-party provider, they are vulnerable to vendor lock-in, thus, can only move from the limitations of the platform;
</p></li></ul><h1 id="lesson-5">Lesson 5</h1><ul><li><p>most organizations want to polish the end-product as much as possible before it reach their customers;
  in software, most applications go through a variety of steps such as putting through a testing suite, building the image with reproducible results, and packaging it for enabling everyone be able to open the app, and deploying it (or an actual release)
</p></li><li><p>to make application development faster, they usually divide it into several environments: one for development where they can change things with minimal risk and one for production, that is, the customer-facing interface
</p></li><li><p>to make it easier, some of them delegate the usual tasks of testing, building, packaging, and deployment to the cloud
</p></li><li><p>this has resulted into the usual practice of continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD)
</p><ul><li><p>CI is a tool for automating testing, building, and packaging the application
</p></li><li><p>CD is a tool for automatic deployment of the application
</p></li></ul></li><li><p>there are many cloud services that offer CI/CD like CircleCI, Jenkins, Travis CI, Gitlab CI, and GitHub Actions
</p><ul><li><p>for this lesson, we&#x27;ll go with GitHub Actions which is the integrated CI/CD workflow for GitHub repos
</p></li><li><p>GitHub Actions enables event-listening jobs
</p></li><li><p>each job are then divided into steps
</p></li><li><p>you can configure GitHub Actions through <code class="inline-verbatim">.github/workflows</code> inside of the GitHub repo
</p></li></ul></li><li><p>in this chapter, they go with ArgoCD which is an application deployment frontend to Kubernetes clusters
</p></li><li><p>with similar configurations, you may want to use templates;
  this is where configuration managers come in;
  this course chooses Helm as the tool of the trade as it is integrated into ArgoCD
</p></li><li><p>Helm is a configuration manager
</p><ul><li><p>it mainly manages charts which are basically packages in a package manager
</p></li><li><p>a chart contains parameterized values which is mainly done through Go templates
</p></li><li><p>Helm recognizes a chart with the <code class="inline-verbatim">Chart.yaml</code> file that contains metadata about the deployment
</p></li></ul></li><li><p>ArgoCD can accept multiple sources including Helm, making it easy to integrate Helm into it
</p></li><li><p>CI/CD tools can be categorized based on the push/pull methodology
</p><ul><li><p>traditionally, CI/CD platforms are push, delivering updates once changes have been pushed into the repository;
    the changes will also be pushed to the CD where it will create new clusters;
    while it makes update flow from new version easier, it also requires more resources and more awareness as it has more chance of a disruption, requiring more resources;
    on the other hand, this makes versioning easier making it easier to debug and analyze
</p></li><li><p>pull-based CI/CD platforms is mostly similar except it will detect changes and apply them to the cluster;
    while this is easier to apply new changes, it also makes it harder to analyze for future improvements
</p></li></ul></li></ul></main></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"metadata":{"date":"\"2021-06-07 18:21:19 +08:00\"","date_modified":"2021-07-20 18:11:06
