Roam Research is a newly developing tool created by Conor White-Sullivan that focuses on creating a graph of notes instead of the traditional hierarchical system of most note-taking systems.
It is largely inspired from [[id:4259636e-e0e8-49e4-8210-758ec59728a3][Zettelkasten]] with the emphasis for [[id:583852e4-e56f-469b-89bc-9e5a832c9f04][Bidirectional links]] among the following list of features.

- Backlinking of notes which are then used for creating a graph of related topics.
- A quick capture system for mobile experience.
- A daily notes system, making this viable as a journal as well.

As such, Roam is a solid note-taking system that easily integrates as a personal information management system.
With the Zettelkasten-inspired system, you can use it to easily [[id:29ecbd86-ad97-4882-aa3f-56b5b90025d5][Create evergreen notes with a digital garden]].
[fn:: Well, it is a glorified wiki with the focus for backlinks and knowledge graph.]

Roam is gaining popularity and more are considering to use it.
However, it is closed source and (thankfully) open source alternatives like [[https://github.com/jethrokuan/org-roam][Org-roam]], [[https://github.com/logseq/logseq][Logseq]], and [[https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron][Dendron]] started to fill our Roam-voided hearts.
