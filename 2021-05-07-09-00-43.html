Writing as if it&#x27;s music keeps the interest of the inner narrator as if they subsconciously demand variety in their reading.
</p><p>To make musical-like quality of writing, the following guidelines can make things easier.
</p><ul><li><p>Vary the sentence length per paragraph.
</p></li><li><p>Instill a gram of personal expression.
</p></li><li><p>Create a playful persona.
</p></li></ul><p>While musical-like writing invoke a sense of creativity and playfulness, it doesn&#x27;t have to be this way.
You can occasionally apply it on certain situations where it can make interesting reading.
Examples include writing in a playful persona when writing explanations and introductions, instilling personality only with short phrases, or creating a short narrative inside of the writing while interleaving technical information.
</p><p>For technical documentations, I think it could be applied.
But not forgetting that you&#x27;re writing for the user who expects an accurate writing with a factual tone.
Several style guides such as from <a href="https://styleguide.mailchimp.com/">Mailchimp</a> has casualness and informality.
Overall, it is going to be a task of balance.
</p><p>It is especially interesting for personal note-taking.
The place where the personal needs are first before a hypothetical reader can make notes of various writing styles with various completeness.
But you shouldn&#x27;t forget that you&#x27;re writing for yourself, not the audience.
