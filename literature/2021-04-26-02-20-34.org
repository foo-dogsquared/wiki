- Not much people who're familiar with Rust, apparently (at least at the time of the talk).
  Nonetheless, Rust-based tools are included.

- Created an importer using the Crates.io API.
  With the importer, it can recursively build the module all the way down (most of the time).

- It pulls all of the dependencies.
  The side effect is that every package has to be defined.
  The importer just makes it easier.

- The community have a preference to shared libraries and sources.
  Vendoring is not much of a popular option.
  Since Rust downloads everything and the community wants to reuse the components, it seems the solution is to package everything.
