- while we associate creativity with originality, it is not the same and it is a bit misleading
- oftentimes, we also mistake creativity with the act of coming up with a never-seen-before idea;
  creativity defines what we can make from already existing ideas
- some examples:
  + musicians often take cues from other musicians;
    see Star Wars soundtrack (or [[https://youtu.be/gB4lULC87Oo][this video where I got the idea]])
  + video games often get their ideas from others
- in other words, what we as innovations are often inspired from combining two or more ideas
- since creativity involves inspirations from already existing ideas including failed ones, [[id:c886bc6d-e9dc-4f62-8841-59123236eda0][A failed idea can be repurposed]];
  in a way, we understand that [[id:114b7874-6a20-49c8-be2c-46970c7110dc][Information is only acquired when you try to make sense of it]]
- though, plagiarism is a different topic entirely
