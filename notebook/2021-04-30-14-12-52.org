The internet is a place full of information.
In fact, too full.

You could consume endless information from one resource to another and create stagnation because you're adapting too many ideas at a time.
[[id:98625da4-8e40-4b3c-bd3e-65781ae1d76f][Time spent on learning a skill should equally spend time for applying said skill]].
It could further your hoarding tendencies and maybe just start collecting knowledge as [[id:6b0e6b75-410f-42a3-8921-bcc4589b2d2a][Collecting information only feels like progress]].

Having a roadmap helps you to stay on track whether you're studying for a job, creating a new project, or learning a new hobby.
This roadmap could be just a simple to-do list, an elaborate plan, or a one-line description of the output you expect [fn:: This is still a terrible example but it should eventually evolve into details.].
