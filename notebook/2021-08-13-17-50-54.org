- not all things in life has to be some grandiose moments
  + not all moments of a critically acclaimed masterpiece of a film is a deliberate decision
  + not all tracks of an album has to be great to be a classic
  + not all parts of a song has to be bombastic
  + not all parts of a game has to be epic
  + not all parts of the picture has to be attention-grabbing
- contrasts give breathing room for people to take all of the stuff we intend to
- in other words, when everything stands out, nothing will
- real-life examples
  + most of the memorable tracks from Touhou are from the final bosses as ZUN makes the best track he can make;
    it makes his game more memorable by building up to the final theme
  + badly-designed advertisements will try to make everything stands out
    (lots of examples in the wild especially if you go to your local events)
