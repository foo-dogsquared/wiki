- this only applies to the mainline games and spin-offs that are very similar to it
- [[roam:Monster Hunter]] mainly drawn in 3D roam:Anime style, akin to 3D [[roam:Phantasy Star]] games
- the mantra of this series is an alternate universe with a grounded take on monster designs;
  the monsters have a realistic and grounded take on their designs mostly inspired from real-life fauna;
  all of their designs relate to their abilities and how they interact with their usual environments
  - Ukanlos is a monster mainly found in icelands;
    featuring a jaw shovelling through the snow;
    its body structure also enables it to swim through the snow
  - Tigrex is a great and simple example;
    a combination of tyrannosaurus rex and a tiger mainly hunting with violent persistence alone
  - Nargacuga is a monster similar to Tigrex except with a jet-black hide, bladed wings, and a spiked tail intended for quick and silent hunting;
    it is another example of simple and great grounded design
  - even in other installments like Monster Hunter: Rise with the presentation of the world as magical, the monsters within it still has a grounded take;
- even in older games, there is a level of realism and can be seen up close from their 3D models;
  it is pretty fantastic to see that kind of detail :)
