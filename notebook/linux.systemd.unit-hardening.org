- main command to interact is ~systemd-analyze security~;
  this will give a list of units along with their exposure score (lower is better);
  - take note the goal to a 1.0 score shouldn't be taken as a goal since not all units need are the same;
    security, after all, is about mitigating against your threat model
  - the only unit possible to attain the lowest score is a simple "Hello world" program or similar so don't go for a 1.0
- several systemd unit options are only available in certain units such as system services
- here is a list of sandboxing-related options;
  for more information, see ~systemd.exec.5~ manual page
  - ~ProtectHome~ will restrict process to interact with ~/home~, ~/root~, and ~/run/user~;
    can accept a boolean or certain values: ~read-only~ will set certain directories to read-only and ~tmpfs~ will mount the temporary filesystems to the directories as read-only;
  - ~ProtectControlGroups~ will make the control group filesystem (i.e., ~/sys/fs/cgroup~) to read-only
  - ~PrivateUsers~, if enabled, will run the processes through another user
  - ~ProtectClock~ prohibits interacting with the system clock
  - ~ProtectKernelModules~ restricts loading of kernel modules
  - ~ProtectKernelLogs~ prevents logging into the kernel ring buffer
  - ~PrivateTmp~ will create a new temporary filesystem for the unit
  - ~PrivateNetwork~ will create a new set of network devices only composing of a loopback network device;
    this will disallow network access and thus should only use for processes with no business with network access
  - ~PrivateDevices~ will create a new set of devices with only the pseudo-devices (e.g., ~/dev/null~, ~/dev/zero~);
    this will restrict device access and should be used for processes with no device access
