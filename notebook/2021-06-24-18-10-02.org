- while we associate creativity with originality, it is not the same and it is a bit misleading
- oftentimes, we also mistake creativity with the act of coming up with a never-seen-before idea;
  creativity defines what we can make from already existing ideas
- you could [[id:0dbfee88-cdce-48d1-9a10-23fc12d9bcd5][Refer to advanced resources when skill-building for a solid short-term goal]] and copy them
- some examples:
  + in general, spiritual successors
  + musicians often take cues from other musicians;
    see Star Wars soundtrack (or [[https://youtu.be/gB4lULC87Oo][this video where I got the idea]])
  + video games often get their ideas from others and create their own version
- in other words, what we consider as innovations are often inspired from combining two or more ideas
- since creativity involves inspirations from already existing ideas including failed ones, [[id:c886bc6d-e9dc-4f62-8841-59123236eda0][Failed ideas can be repurposed]];
  in a way, we understand that [[id:114b7874-6a20-49c8-be2c-46970c7110dc][Information is only acquired when you try to make sense of it]] by trying how two ideas can be integrated
- this is basically how [[id:d885e93b-f919-4338-a6b9-3438538e18c0][Every copy of the techniques is personalized]]
- though, plagiarism is a different topic entirely
