- people often underestimated what they can achieve in a year;
  meanwhile, they often overestimate what they can do in a day
- examples:
  + people tend to overshoot what they can finish in a day but cannot gauge what they can do in a week
  + people expect they would reach expert-level playing music over weeks compared to the same practice pace they will do in months
- a lot of times, people stop when they can't see progress;
  then they may enter into an tutorial hell as [[id:03cd9fad-e187-4939-9347-1a034c6efbe2][Overanalyzing slow you down]]
- just showing up consistently can make progress that will improve your work;
  [[id:05a39f96-fb1c-4d71-9be1-fc4c2e251e8f][Start small and improve later]];
  you'll make more progress through multiple iterations
- however, consistency without improvements over a select period of time is essentially just repetition;
  [[id:e994f2d6-c9d6-4ca8-9dfe-fcc69414e0a4][Repetition is not understanding]]
- additionally, don't put too much eggs in one basket;
  don't put too much time into making consistent;
  let yourself relax as [[id:2667d942-48b6-4d1e-b92b-15c2dab645ed][Switching between different topics makes new perspective]]
