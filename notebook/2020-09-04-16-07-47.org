[[https://nixos.org/][Nix]] is a package manager that pioneered [[id:bfed6daf-4c2b-4426-bab9-2804caa5e079][Functional package management]] which addresses the criticisms of traditional Unix systems while making it as a specialized tool for [[id:6eeb7a24-b662-46d6-9ece-00a5028ff4d8][Reproducible research]].
It features a handrolled configuration language (also called Nix) that leans into functional paradigm, making it easier if you have experience on it.
A popular tool mostly featured in Haskell programming projects.

Eventually inspired GNU to create a fork, [[id:be917383-84c4-4bf5-9ca0-b04bfb778f4f][Guix package manager]], that takes it to another direction with more focus on reproducibility and its extensions such as bootstrapping.
