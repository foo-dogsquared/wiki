- information is infinite and there's only so little we can take;
  the writers should take note of their target audience with the prerequisite knowledge and the average knowledge ceiling they're willing to take
- how we take information can change given the same information when structured differently;
  argument structure matters more
- one way to present information is to give an overview then slowly breaking the details down;
  a [[id:05a39f96-fb1c-4d71-9be1-fc4c2e251e8f][Start small and improve later]]-type of ideal
- while this point is applied mostly for roam:Writing and [[id:0d2264a6-e487-4761-818a-d17d2833120f][Note-taking]] introductory materials, this also works with technical documents with the benefit of being easier to be referenced in the future
- examples
  - [[id:d0982ce9-6b39-482a-990c-f333d33a4a2a][CS50x]] is a computer science course presented with this in mind intended for people with absolute zero prequisite knowledge;
    the introduction to strings in C, for example, is a more specific example of this by presenting them first as another type then later breaking it down as an array (of characters) which is introduced later
  - [[https://www.youtube.com/c/inanutshell][Kurzgesagt]] is a channel that mostly does this especially given their video format;
    in fact, they even have a [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFqn3uy238E][video]] relating to this point
