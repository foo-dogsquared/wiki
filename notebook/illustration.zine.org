Stands for "fan-made magazines".
However, we're looking at programming zines similar to [[https://jvns.ca/][Julia Evans]] and [[https://twitter.com/sailorhg][sailorhg]].




* Style guides

- 24px is the ideal size for the writing.
- Integrating text with multimedia, basically almost like a formal magazine or pure drawing in comics format.
- Will use Krita as the drawing tool.
  Create a template for my mini-zines.

Things to consider (aside from personality, of course):

- One-line description
- The simplest example possible
- A real-life example
- Documentation links
- Alternatives
- Integration

Be sure to practice the following:

- Good typography practice (even in writing)
- An intuitive navigation (you know, like in comics/manga)
