- A universal database with semi-structured data allowing for natural queries.
- Each item in the database contains statements which in turn contain properties.
- Querying tools are available (e.g., https://query.wikidata.org/, wikibase-cli).
- item + statement + property
- The item itself and its part are assigned a unique ID â€” e.g., the item "GNU Guix" is assigned to "Q18968627" and it has a logo image statement is which assigned at "P154".
- Wikidata-related SDKs and APIs are available for interacting with the data without using the website.
