# TODO: Try out non-systemd way of network configuration.
#       Now you have to try out something like FreeBSD or OpenBSD.
To access the internet, you need the following components:

- The driver of the network device installed and enabled.
  (See [[id:a7d9897e-fbaa-4ab1-a26d-4a86d2621df8][Linux drivers]] for more details.)
- A network manager to manage your network devices ;p
- A DNS resolver to access domain names which are aliases to IP addresses.

There are competing components to manage your network configurations.

- There is [[https://networkmanager.dev/][NetworkManager]] that has been the standard way for managing networks.
  It is being used in roam:GNOME as the backend for their network management interface.

- If you're using systemd-ful environment, you can start with [[id:e4dba4ef-71dd-4d30-9a2c-4ad97223510b][systemd-networkd]].
