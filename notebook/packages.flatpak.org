- a Flatpak package usually is an application that depends on runtimes which are collections of library
- while runtimes can be created, there are only a handful of them in the official Flathub remote
- some of the runtimes include Freedesktop, GNOME, and KDE
- you can run the runtimes to know the installed packages (e.g., ~flatpak run org.freedesktop.Sdk//19.08~)
- examples:
  + [[https://github.com/flathub/com.mojang.Minecraft/][Minecraft]] is fairly simple by fetching the compiled binary and its dependencies with minimal compilation needed
  + [[https://github.com/flathub/com.rawtherapee.RawTherapee][RawTherapee]] is slightly complex with various dependencies defined mostly in one file
  + [[https://github.com/flathub/org.gnucash.GnuCash][Gnucash]] has a complex manifest that is composed of multiple dependencies packages as its own module file
