There is something powerful in seeing others doing the task as you are now seeing the process in action.
A possible reason is our human tendency to follow by example.

Watching live sessions in any form can be a good way to learn and gain perspectives as you're viewing the raw footage of the task from its conception to its completion.
This is why seeing live sessions such as live studying, live coding, and speedpainting sessions are compelling to watch.

Even pre-rendered forms of live sessions such as documentaries, pre-recorded competition matches, behind-the-scenes footage, and commentaries are great to look for albeit incomplete.
It still gives you an idea of the process behind the topic.
