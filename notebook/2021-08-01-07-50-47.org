- a written specific use case showcases multiple things;
  a step-by-step tutorial mostly follow one with a fixed path
- usually because it [[id:3a605fb2-b867-41c2-bcf9-00ef772808e5][Show the result at the front]];
  similar reasons as to why [[id:e158b742-53c7-4442-9af3-489ea8240af9][Examples and stories are more memorable than explanations]]
- examples:
  + devlogs which a lot of the [[roam:Game development]] creates
  + a lot of blog posts that tackles only one specific thing by its author usually to make them remember that thing
- from a content creator perspective, it creates more interesting options (e.g., skits, persona) that are usually unneeded in a tutorial;
  it can take advantage of our tendency to [[id:9a11ef31-b2a7-43a9-a7a9-48f191838c6e][Prefer referencing over remembering]] by being more memorable
- with it, we can [[id:0dbfee88-cdce-48d1-9a10-23fc12d9bcd5][Refer to advanced resources when skill-building for a solid short-term goal]]
- this is not a false dichotomy, overall;
  a tutorial can make for a interesting piece if it's leaning more on specific use cases
