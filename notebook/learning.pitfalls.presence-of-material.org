- this is similar to how [[id:6b0e6b75-410f-42a3-8921-bcc4589b2d2a][Collecting information only feels like progress]];
  only then when we open a book or logged into an e-learning website, we may feel we have already learned the material

  [[roam:Recall reinforces better learning]] by relying entirely from your understanding
- additionally, you can also do [[id:2667d942-48b6-4d1e-b92b-15c2dab645ed][Switching between different topics makes new perspective]];
