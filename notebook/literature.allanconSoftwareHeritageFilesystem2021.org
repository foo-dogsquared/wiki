- primarily features =swh-fuse=, a utility allowing to mount software from Software Heritage to your local environment
- it is based from POSIX filesystems built with FUSE framework;
  as such it does not require root privileges to use it
- it exposes the global merkle tree as a filesystem along with its metadata, archive, etc.
- it can interact with the objects in the merkle tree such as the source code files, commits, snapshots, etc.
- the tool is essentially a FUSE adapter to Software Heritage API

features:
- the tool loads the archives lazily to save bandwidth and disk space
- caches for performance especially with how bad remote filesystems can be
- reduces redundancy by using symlinks extensively
