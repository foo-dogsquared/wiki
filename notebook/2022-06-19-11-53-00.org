- see [[id:c64836f4-19db-4da7-8532-4ebacf6c1ed1][How Linux distributions are technically their own operating system]];
  we'll present two polarizing sides for this question
- on the side of "Yes"
  - it can be beneficial as most users see it in a similar way;
    the newcomers would have to be familiar with the common concepts between the mainstream distros;
    having presented as a collective single effort makes it easier for communities to communicate between each other
  - the notion of Linux distros being the same with different configuration does have a grain of truth to it;
    presenting it as such is not exactly misleading
- on the side of "No"
  - if presented as a single thing, the newcomers' expectation can be mislead with the notion that all distros are the same;
    having explicitly introduced as an entirely different operating system can be an easier time since the user will tend to find more similarities than differences like some sort of [[id:5c603e2c-4dae-465e-abb5-12897ad7466d][Tunnel vision]];
    this potential problem could be present with the group that expected different but it will be dealt in a different way since they already have an expectation that two Linux distros are different to one another
  - most users seem to address Linux referring to the overall Linux ecosystem, not the individual operating system, subtleties of languages and all;
    the Linux distro of choice is still its own bubble and it should be the main focus when presenting a Linux distro
- overall this depends on how the Linux ecosystem is being presented and the user themselves;
  this question has explicit focus on *expectation and required technical expertise* for the user;
  both answers can end the same as it still requires effort from the user
