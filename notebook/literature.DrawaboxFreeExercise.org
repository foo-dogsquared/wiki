- a good roam:Illustration course for absolute beginners;
  though, this is not a good course if you're exclusively following this;
  I advice to mix other course



# TODO: Upload the exercise pictures
* Lesson 0

- this is a chapter that is quite more insightful than I thought
- it mainly preps you up on expectations, attitudes, and prerequisites needed to tackle the course more effectively
- among them is the separation between fun and training (e.g., 50% rule)
- it is an interesting point that training and drawing for the sake of drawing (e.g., for fun) should be separated
- it also sets the expectation of the author to their audience;
  for example, the course itself is set for absolute beginners and self-taught artists (that hopefully realized how little they know about things);
  the course also expects students to follow the instructions to the letter and emphasizes how exercises should be used
- grinding and mastery over the exercises is discouraged mostly because it is a waste of time that could've been used somewhere else;
  the focus is to build a foundation similar to [[id:05a39f96-fb1c-4d71-9be1-fc4c2e251e8f][Start small and improve later]]
- do some warm ups before taking on the exercises




* Lesson 1

- since writing and drawing both involves the pen, there are some habits that we bring when starting to draw;
  one of the most common form is our grip;
- we mostly use only our wrist which is suitable for creating precise and finer detailed lines;
  this is perfectly fine for letters but not for lines that come in a variety of length
- beyond our wrist, we can use our whole arm and shoulder;
  this enables to easily create longer lines with confidence
- this course also enforces to draw with the whole arm;
  the way to do this is to simply glide and practice with the following exercises
- if you're familiar with or have seen figure drawing videos, there are some certain beliefs to grip the "correct way" with the backhand grip;
  just like in [[id:4b33103b-7f64-4b51-8f03-cac06d4001bb][Programming]] where people insists the best way to code with different paradigms to the point of dogma, there is a resemblance when it comes to arguing the best way to hold;
  it is best to know however that things apply differently in different context (i.e., the backhand grip is only applicable to pencils, not pens)


** Exercise comments

- Superimposed lines - this is an exercise enforcing to draw with your arm;
  it is a straightforward exercise so far
- Ghosted Lines - this is where the ghosting method is introduced which is essential as more exercises will build upon this technique;
  it is an interesting exercise especially for me having some hand-eye coordination issues ;p
- Ghosted Planes - this is "Ghosted Lines" exercise but on steroids;
  enforces the ghosting method even more
- Tables of Ellipses - this is where I have problems with creating smooth ellipses;
  I eventually realized my problem is how I grip and how it fall backs to creating ellipses with my wrist instead of my arm;
  it's harder than I thought to draw circles with a pen;
  this is a habitual problem and will work out on this;
  I'm very tempted to restart this exercise but as the course says "No grinding and attempts at mastery before moving to each exercise"
