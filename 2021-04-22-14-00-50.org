Zettelkasten is a note-taking method popularized by Niklas Luhmann known for his prolific writings from 400 academic articles to 70 books in a lifetime.
This system, manifested as a shelf of 60,000 notes, was credited as his writing partner.

The main idea of this system is creating a global cloud of atomic notes without any hierarchy or separation.
This non-linear system encourages freely linking between each ideas making it easier for gaining new ideas similar to neurons in your brain.

To make it more efficient, the workflow further describes the idea of creating good future-proof notes (see [[file:2021-04-07-18-53-58.org][Future-proofing your notes is only worth if the future is relevant]]).
Most writings about this seem to agree to the following ideas.

- A method to capture notes on-the-fly.
  This encourages to capture as many ideas as possible.

- The lack of hierarchy to describe the notes.
  This enforces easier organization and classifying your notes.

- The gradual improvement of the captured notes into [[file:2020-05-07-21-53-21.org][Evergreen notes]].
