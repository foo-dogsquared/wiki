- advice, suggestions, whatchamacallit should only be used as frameworks, not a dogma
- furthermore, advice are contextual;
  what works from the person whose giving the advice is different from yours from the environment, financial status, etc.
- examples:
  + in note-taking, you may have heard of making [[id:431532c3-6506-4565-b193-dbfb60eac7d6][Evergreen notes]] with one idea per note;
    some may take the advice in a literal sense;
    alternatively, atomicity can be interpreted as one message that can be made of multiple ideas which works more for you
  + in productivity, multiple advice on habits have been thrown such as the Pomodoro technique and bullet journaling;
    some may practice as-is but you can modify the number of reps in a Pomodoro session or add another type of bullet for writing
- eventually the advice will depend on your interpretation;
  [[id:d885e93b-f919-4338-a6b9-3438538e18c0][Every copy of the techniques is personalized]]
- additionally, when giving advice, most people can read between the lines;
  it's not like they cannot understand context
