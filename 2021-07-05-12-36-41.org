- unnecessary optimizations are unnecessary wasting of time that could've been used for something else more worthy;
  the problem, however, is it can be addicting
- this is affecting people of all walks of life that it has various names: productivity porn, yak shaving, and pre-optimizing software;
  in other words, the perfectionist stereotype
- a lot of the improvements we do often comes from new ideas;
  thus, there is an incentive to present it as a new and shiny thing that you should try it out that easily reaches [[id:909b4830-72c8-4943-be47-efaf77e40253][Professional narcissism]]
- most of the time, this can be harmful:
  + this can be seen with self-help and productivity culture with gurus presenting themselves as someone who finally figured it out how to get into a constant productive state — e.g., a new method of note-taking, habit management methods, productivity applications showcase
  + part of the Linux ricing desktop community where software are fetishized to make their computing experience to be more productive — e.g., text editors galore, tiling window managers versus traditional desktops, command line versus graphical tools, quests for mouseless computing, learning new keyboard layouts
  + the gaming community has much emphasis on how to game more effectively with specialized mice and keyboards, wide monitors, and software setups
  + on programming, there is a tendency for making the optimized program at early stages or unnecessary optimizations on non-critical code
- the simplest solution is to get into the mindset of "good enough" and reflecting if it is really worth it at the end;
