Ever since [[id:24b5e144-dda4-482c-9684-958a00d6c986][Roam Research]] became a popular option for [[id:0d2264a6-e487-4761-818a-d17d2833120f][Note-taking]], there has been interest in one of its popular features: bidirectional linking.
This feature alone allows for a different way of thinking about note-taking — notes are better to be associative instead of hierarchical just like how our brain works.
It allows for other Roam features such as backlinking and a visual representation of the notes with a graph.

Compared to monodirectional links like in the web, bidirectional links have inherent social awareness: the ability to look back to linked pages.
With this feature, you can easily form a graph of pages which you can easily establish contextual relationships between them.
This is a feature that I've often sought after especially for technical websites such as [[https://encyclopediaofmath.org/][Encyclopedia of Mathematics]].

That said, bidirectional links are not a silver bullet.
If this is implemented on the web today, it would cause a lot of problems — spamming, trollish linking, and the fact you have no control over what pages being linked to your page requiring heavier moderation.
Hence, this is more suitable for certain situations such as personal wikis (see [[id:29ecbd86-ad97-4882-aa3f-56b5b90025d5][Create evergreen notes with a digital garden]]).
Certain software such as Mediawiki, Dokuwiki, and Tiddlywiki offer this feature either as a built-in feature or an extension.
[fn:: Well, most of them have it as an extension.]
