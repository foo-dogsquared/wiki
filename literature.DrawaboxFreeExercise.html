  it is a straightforward exercise so far
</p></li><li><p>Ghosted Lines - this is where the ghosting method is introduced which is essential as more exercises will build upon this technique;

</p></li><li><p>Ghosted Planes - this is &quot;Ghosted Lines&quot; exercise but on steroids;
  enforces the ghosting method even more
</p></li><li><p>Tables of Ellipses - this is where I have problems with creating smooth ellipses;
  I eventually realized my problem is how I grip and how it fall backs to creating ellipses with my wrist instead of my arm;
  it&#x27;s harder than I thought to draw circles with a pen;
  it&#x27;s a disaster;
  this is a habitual problem and will work out on this;
  I&#x27;m very tempted to restart this exercise but as the course says &quot;No grinding and attempts at mastery before moving to each exercise&quot;
</p></li><li><p>Ellipses in Planes - I&#x27;ve done a little warm up with creating ellipses with the ghosting method and it indeed improve my ellipses unlike the previous disastrous result;
  most of the ellipses appear to be confident but not much in accuracy;
  that&#x27;s the next thing to be worked on the upcoming warm ups, I guess
