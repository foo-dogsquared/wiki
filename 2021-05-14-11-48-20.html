It is often underestimated.
You may have often hear something along the lines of &quot;I don&#x27;t want to memorize a bunch of facts but rather understand the process.&quot; or &quot;Knowing something is different from understanding something.&quot;;
it is rooted from an experience of bad teaching thus we associate memorizing a bunch of facts as bad.
</p><p>Knowing the related things — or memorizing a bunch of facts — is a good way to start learning a concept.
With those things in mind, you can then combine the ideas, <a href="/wiki/learning.chunking">Chunking</a> them, and innovate new ones.
You cannot build upon more ideas if you don&#x27;t know what those ideas are in the first place.
