#+title: Create a writing inbox to store your thoughts


One of the best practices for [[file:note-taking.org][Note-taking]] is writing [[file:20200625131209-fleeting_notes.org][Fleeting notes]] which are used to store essential information so that your brain doesn't have to.
Our brain is not good for storing ideas, only creating and jumping between them.

Since fleeting notes are only made for quickly capturing thoughts, its input is often messy.
The very least we can do to consistently retrieve our messy thoughts is to put it in a place: a writing inbox where we store all of our fleeting notes.

We can then revisit our inbox for recalling.
In my case, I use the inbox for task management and writing [[file:evergreen-notes.org][Evergreen notes]].

Like our emails, our writing inbox should be cleaned up each time we visit our inbox.
Feel free to remove entries that are not in need and replace them with new ones.
If you want to store an idea for an indefinite future (e.g., a project idea, future hobbies) that you cannot surely do now, you can create an inbox for future ideas.
(On the other hand, extending this system is closer to the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done][Getting things done (GTD) method]].)
