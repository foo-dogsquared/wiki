# TODO: visual aid of the basics of this technique
A learning technique that uses familiar environments for better recalling.
For example, you can use your house as a layout and putting new concepts in it such as the related memory for mathematical formulae (e.g., the formula for an area of a square [\(s^2\)] is remembered as 2 stuffed toys, area of an triangle [\(1/2 * bh\)] as a half-hobo).
You can then write a crazy narrative with those things â€” e.g., outside of the house are 2 stuffed toys (area of square) and through the entrance is a half-dressed hobo.
The core of this technique is learning through overlaying familiar topics with newer concepts.

This is effective for memorizing since [[id:9f1f35dd-7cf9-4f47-a9a9-b647e5daa2af][We are more associative than structured]] along with our tendency of chunking.
