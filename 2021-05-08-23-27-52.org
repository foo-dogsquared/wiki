# TODO: visual aid of the basics of this technique
A learning technique that uses familiar environments for better recalling.
For example, you can use your house as a layout and putting new concepts in it such as the related memory for mathematical formulae (e.g., the formula for an area of a square [\(s^2\)] is remembered as 2 stuffed toys, area of an triangle [\(1/2 * bh\)] as a half-hobo).
You can then write a crazy narrative with those things â€” e.g., outside of the house are 2 stuffed toys (area of square) and through the entrance is a half-dressed hobo.
The core of this technique is learning through overlaying familiar topics with newer concepts.

This is effective for memorizing since [[id:9f1f35dd-7cf9-4f47-a9a9-b647e5daa2af][We are more associative than structured]] along with our tendency of [[id:1e135aee-0464-4756-9f55-bbf12afe8254][Chunking]].

Memory palaces are one of the more known technique from memory sports.
Notice how most of them tend to make a lot of effort grouping items together and weaving them with familiar concepts such as their house.
Another interesting thing with this technique is the test of creativity.
Going back to the memory sports scene, they usually employ this technique by creating a narrative leaning on crazier side of things.
This makes it more memorable and easier to write more things on top of the wacky antics.
