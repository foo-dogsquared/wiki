</p><p>It was first realized from the thesis &quot;<a href="id:f2e1e2f3-cc34-4c76-91d4-2706ce7756d2">The Purely Functional Software Deployment Model</a>&quot;.
</p><p>The conceptual overview of it is similar to <a href="/wiki/2020-09-04-19-57-06">Functional programming</a> with how it views with data and functions (in this case, packages and build processes).
It views that packages are a unique result from combining different things: dependencies, build processes, versions, and more.
If a dependency has updated its patch version or a build instruction has revised with one line of change, it will result in a &quot;new&quot; package as the output even if the package isn&#x27;t any different.
</p><p>Coming from a functional approach, it also features statelessness and immutability, making it a reliable toolkit for <a href="https://reproducible-builds.org/">reproducible builds</a> (thus gaining a reach for <a href="/wiki/2020-04-12-11-20-53">Reproducible research</a>).
</p><p>The problems that FPM attempts to solve come from the critique of the traditional package management which is still dominant as of today (2020-08-31).
Here are some of the problems on a traditional Linux-based system:
</p><ul><li><p>The statefulness of the entire system leads to similar situations on Windows&#x27; dependency hell problem.
</p></li><li><p>As a consequence of the statefulness, traceability is almost non-existent.
</p></li><li><p>Multiple versions of packages are hard to place side-by-side which is used by developers targetting stable versions while experimenting with the latest versions.
</p></li><li><p>Destructive ongoing updates which consists of replacing the current version with the updated version while the update is going.
</p></li></ul><p>The functional approach with the unique output and immutable variables addresses the listed problems in some way.
</p><ul><li><p>A package is built from an input resulting in a package on a unique immutable location, eliminating the statefulness in the process.
</p></li><li><p>Since each revision results in a new location, the same package with different versions can be easily placed side-by-side.
</p></li><li><p>With the way how packages built, the old system can be kept giving the possibility for the user to rollback to those previous versions.
