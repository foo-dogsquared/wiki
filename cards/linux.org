** Front
How to list devices information?
(I mean all sorts of devices.)
** Back
- ~lspci~ is the most acceptable answer since it comprehensive lists all of the devices.
- ~lsusb~ list USB-connected devices.
- ~lsblk~ list the block devices which usually includes storage drives and such.

How does a shell find the binaries?
** Back
Most shell searches through the ~$PATH~ variable, a colon-delimited list of paths containing the binaries.

** Front
How to test out systemd timestamps?
** Back
~systemd-analyze {calendar,timestamp,timespan}~

To know how the format (i.e., calendar, timestamp, and timespan) looks like, you can refer to ~man systemd.time.5~.
