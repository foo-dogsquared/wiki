Remember: <a href="/wiki/2021-07-15-07-26-52">Overanalyzing slow you down</a>.
</p><p>The solution to prevent the tendency to overanalyze is simple: just start one.
It doesn&#x27;t matter how low the quality is, it serves as a foundation for you to know what could be improved.
It is pointless task especially if you have absolute zero experience.
</p><p>Instead of thinking that learning and improving a skill as a linear process jump to a higher level with a more ambitious and over-the-top project, you could think of creating projects as an iterative process improving your grand vision of things with each step.
For each project you start, it could be the next version towards the realization of your dream project.
The most important point for this is a good sense of skill improves over time.
Since time is a (more important) limited resource, you may as well make as many of them as possible.
With it, you&#x27;re getting a sense of what is good and bad practice with the previous projects.
This is especially important as you remember more of your projects early on your journey.
</p><p>This project-based thinking process can be lent to several situations.
</p><ul><li><p>When starting a YouTube channel, focus on putting out more videos.
  Over time, you&#x27;ll know what is good practice for a decent audio and you tend to notice what is a better way of presenting something.
  A bonus that you might have an audience at that point with the time you might spend overthinking and preparing for it.
</p></li><li><p>When producing music, create and publish them.
  Over time, you&#x27;ll know what is good mixing or good melody with your previous projects especially with the bad pieces.
</p></li><li><p>When <a href="/wiki/2021-07-22-14-09-26">Programming</a>, make more programs of varying usefulness.
  Over time, you&#x27;ll have experiences building habits on how to solve problems and search effectively for a topic.
</p></li><li><p>When learning <a href="/wiki/2020-12-26-13-30-39">Illustration</a>, draw more pieces.
  Over time, you&#x27;ll know what bad anatomy looks like and effectively improve your visualization to create more dynamic illustrations.
</p></li></ul><p>The above situations pretty much assumes that you&#x27;re doing it from self-learning.
Just remember that <a href="/wiki/2021-07-22-14-24-00">Self-learning is about responsibility</a>.
</p><p>While having more of the lower quality work can be detrimental, <a href="/wiki/2021-06-24-18-08-23">Failed ideas can be repurposed</a>.
You do have a mountainous amount of bad ideas that could be combined into something better which is nice for ideations.
</p><p>However, this tendency is without its problems.
Being focus on quantity on a longer time creates stagnation and bad habits start to stick.
To prevent as much fallout as possible, put some time for <a href="/wiki/2020-07-06-23-55-47">Deliberate practice</a> and start focusing on quality.
</p><p>Beyond quantity versus quality, it can be good to balance them.
Putting some time on quantity means that you can put your muscle memory to good use, almost like <a href="/wiki/2021-04-07-18-19-11">Spaced repetition</a>.
On other hand, it is important to <a href="/wiki/2021-04-30-14-12-52">Create roadmaps to stay on track</a> and put deadlines to create a reasonable amount of work over a period of time.
