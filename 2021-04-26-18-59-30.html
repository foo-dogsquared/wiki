The time you spent making things align as if you have OCD could be spent editing and improving other notes.
</p><p>Personal notes, no matter how poorly written or unmaintained, are still valuable.
So if you have tendencies like this, just relax and correct them. :)
Trashing notes should be taken as a last resort if you&#x27;re sure it is not relevant to you in the present and in the near future.
Still, you should keep in mind that <a href="/wiki/2021-04-07-18-53-58">Future-proofing your notes is only worth if the future is relevant</a>.
</p><p>Found some inconsistent titles?
Improper metadata?
Incorrect datetime format?
Just correct them as you stumble upon them.
</p><p>Other examples include:
</p><ul><li><p>Satisfying my obsessiveness over the little things such as sorting lines for the note metadata in alphanumerical order.
</p></li><li><p>Finding the perfect note system and constantly shopping for better tools.
</p></li><li><p>Consequently from the previous point, obsessing over the fact that the first draft of my notes are not perfect.

</p></li></ul><p>A similar dilemma I have yesterday is trying to format the metadata my Org mode files and sorting them alphabetically.
I&#x27;ve written a script and as I&#x27;m not experienced in text processing, I spent most of my time reading up documentation on the tools.
I did learned something with the tools but I&#x27;ve realized it&#x27;s a big waste of time especially if my notes have grown.
If I found another hip and new note-taking method and it doesn&#x27;t conform to the new ideal notes in my mind, then I should relax and try it out.
If it&#x27;s good and I integrated it, I&#x27;ll simply link it to my old notes.
