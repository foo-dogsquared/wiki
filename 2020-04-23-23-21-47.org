Personal information management (PIM) is self-explanatory as it is.

This also includes managing [[id:ccb3bc14-a801-4ed0-b066-50b1bcd853aa][File metadata]], [[roam:Note-taking]], library management, and much more.




* Practicing information management

While there's no correct way to practice PIM but to start:

- [[id:66337935-420c-40e6-81a6-f74ab0965ed5][Maintain your own digital library]] which can make managing personal belongings from your personal photos, academic libraries and references, and your anime collection all the more easier.

- While not a good one, the 3-2-1 rule is a good starting point for practicing backups.
  The rule is simple: 3 copies of your data stored in 2 media (e.g., internal hard drive, external storage) with at least 1 of them stored offsite of your computer (e.g., remote location, cloud service).

- Start to manage [[id:ccb3bc14-a801-4ed0-b066-50b1bcd853aa][File metadata]] but only for the most relevant resources.
