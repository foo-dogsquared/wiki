niv is a template generator for a quick start of creating a Nix environment with full reproducibility.
It allows for a quick configuration of where to pin certain package sets (e.g., nixpkgs, NUR, your own package set) with a command line program.

- ~niv init~
- Configuring your pins with ~niv show $SOURCE~ and editing =nix/sources.json= generated from ~niv init~.
- Using it by importing from your Nix files (e.g., =default.nix=, =shell.nix=).

You can also update the pins with ~niv update $SOURCE~ and you don't have to manually look into the repo for updating the pins.
Though, Nix flakes are still the more attractive options IMO.
