- a CI/CD tool integrated into GitHub
- it is free for public repos but limited time per month for private repos
- focused into creating workflows which can be separate and applied in different contexts
  + a workflow is activated from an event
  + stored in ~.github/workflows~ in the remote repo
- each workflow can run a job which are composed of steps
- each step make uses an action which is basically a script;
  it can interact with the repo or do something else entirely without ever touching it
