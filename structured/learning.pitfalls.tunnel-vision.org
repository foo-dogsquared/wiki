- being invested in an idea that it blocks other ideas;
  this makes it harder to solve new problems where they expect to work similarly from their experience;
  it is a net negative if we force our way with the familiar solution while not understanding the new type of problem
- [[id:9f1f35dd-7cf9-4f47-a9a9-b647e5daa2af][We are more associative than structured]];
  we tend to create connections between different things including new things
- it is present on most experts with their experience on the field;
  but this is also a potential problem for students in training where certain principles are taught then encountering a new idea overall
- This is the reason why most of the discoveries are made either by young people or those who haven't formally trained for the original field.
- to combat against this, we can do roam:Interleaving
- by the same principle, we could also let our attention switch at times;
