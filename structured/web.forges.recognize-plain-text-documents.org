Some of the web forges such as GitHub and Gitlab uses [[https://github.com/github/linguist][linguist]] framework to recognize the language and blob files.
By setting Git attributes with =.gitattributes= file, you can set a certain option to make it recognize the plain-text files.
It is what makes the technology list from the repo.

Oftentimes in these web forges, linguist is configured to not detect certain files like plain-text documents (e.g., Markdown, Asciidoctor, Org mode, ReStructuredText).

Here's an example =.gitattributes= file to make Org mode and Asciidoctor documents be recognized.

#+begin_src gitattributes
*.org linguist-detectable=true
*.adoc linguist-detectable=true
#+end_src
