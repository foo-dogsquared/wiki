The family's favorite fuzzy finder.
Basically, it takes a list then create an interface out of it.
Not only it is easy to use and very flexible but also very configurable with the options to let you choose the keybindings and the previewer among other things.




* Options

- =-m, --multi= - enables multiple selection; by default, the keybinding to select is =Tab=
- =-p, --prompt= - display the prompt message
- =--disabled= - disable the search making fzf essentially a selection interface
- =--cycle= - enables cyclic scrolling in the selection (it's annoying when it does not have those)

  If no input was passed, it will recursively list all of the files in the current directory.
  Pretty useful for a quick opening interface.




* Examples

My favorite section where I get to show off some scripts featuring the star of the show.
And also this is where everyone is going to go first.


** Basic command-line file selection

#+begin_src bash
fzf | xargs xdg-open
#+end_src


** Quick manual page selection

#+begin_src shell
apropos . \
    | fzf --multi --prompt "Choose manual(s) to open > " \
    | awk '{ print $1 "." gensub(/[()]/, "", "g", $2) }' \
    | xargs man
#+end_src


** Goto directory with fzf and Bash

With my favorite =find= replacement, [[https://github.com/sharkdp/fd][=fd=]].
It's a Bash function since [[https://stackoverflow.com/a/255415][you can't propagate directory changes with a script]].
Just have to put it somewhere in your configuration.

#+begin_src bash
function fzf-cd() {
    local dir=${1:-$(pwd)}
    local dest=$(fd --type directory --hidden --base-directory "$dir" --follow | fzf --prompt "Where to go? > ")
    [[ $dest ]] && cd "$(realpath --logical "$dir")/$dest"
}
#+end_src

Even better when you bind it with a keyboard shortcut (e.g., ~bind '"\C-f":'fzf-cd\n"'~ on your Bash config).


** Package selection in Arch Linux

Vanilla Arch, if that matters.
You can do this on other operating systems as long as their package manager lets you list all of the packages either from your local database or from a remote server.

#+begin_src shell
pacman -S --list --quiet \
    | fzf --multi --prompt "Install package(s) > " \
    | xargs doas pacman -S --noconfirm
#+end_src
