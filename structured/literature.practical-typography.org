One of my favorite books especially with well-written summaries for each topic.

- typography is relevant for everyone who writes
- what typography is:
  + involved whenever the text is displayed by the billboard, printed in a paper, or drafted in the wall
  + has a function just like photography or web design where practitioners will use whatever techniques to raise the level of their work
  + *main function is to hold reader attention*
  + a tool to improve your writing
- what typography is not:
  + usage of fonts (or entirely composed of fonts)
  + a substitute for your writing
- what good typography is:
  + reinforces your message
  + goal-oriented and utilitarian, not based on taste;
    an aesthetically pleasing text that doesn't enforce your message is considered a failure;
    otherwise, an unappealing look that does reinforce your text is considered a success
- spacing before and after are more subtle and effective
- prefer bold over italics since it is easier to see
- while justified alignment looks nice, often they don't look well when applied automatically with software;
  in such case, prefer left-align instead
- fonts usage:
  + prefer to use two sets of fonts for the body and the headings
  + it doesn't mean to use two different font families, though;
    you can use one font family by setting the headings to use bold
  + use point size larger than 12pt, another old habit from newspapers;
    oftentimes it is not enough to see it in our display and it forces the user to go closer to the display (not exactly what you want)
- paragraphs:
  + no double-spacing per sentence, it is an old and unnecessary habit picked up for today
  + one way to mark a paragraph is first-line indents
  + another is newlines at the end of the paragraph
  + choose only one way to mark a paragraph otherwise it is overkill
  + avoid widows and orphans;
    most software lets you do this automatically
  + line spacing shouldn't be single spaced as it will make dense lines and hard to read;
    otherwise, it also shouldn't be doubly spaced since it will make loose lines;
    the ideal spacing is between 120% to 150% (of course, depending on the font)
- headings:
  + should structure your arguments, not your document
  + prefer in title cases because your headings are not titles
  + limit to 2/3 levels of heading, otherwise, it will make navigation confusing (unless you're writing a technical specification)
