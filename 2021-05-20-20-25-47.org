- when starting to learn, diving into problems are often seen as a bad thing
- it is essentially like trying to learn to swim on an ocean
  + it could be effective if we have a lifeguard
- this sink-or-swim mentality can be great if we're to make a difficult problem as our model for progress
- for example, if you're trying to learn 3D modelling by recreating a massive landscape, you can start with it as an initial exercise
- at first try, it will fail but you can retry maybe next month to see how well you improve
- a difficult problem can give us a clear indication of our progress
- contrast this to learning by starting with the simplest possible example
- in some capacity, we already have been doing this since we have an idea of what we want to do
  + a lot of our inspirations tend to be people with advanced levels
- beware, [[roam:Diving head-first into a difficult problem makes a bad start]]
