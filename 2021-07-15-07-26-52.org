# TODO: Correct examples, please?
- thinking too much about a thing brings out all of the unnecessary details, making it harder to act upon something
- this is where [[id:0e2c9eaf-f12a-47b2-9c9c-d1a590db131b][Involuntary attention switch is good for preventing tunnel vision]];
  furthermore, it mostly prevents [[id:9138397a-a965-45e9-97ea-71849e8d4f94][Overlearning]] as you choose more time into moving on to the action
- it can be good to have too big of a list equating to more choices but for situations where we have to choose one (or a handful), this situation may rise
- this is present in various fields:
  + on sports, competitors tend to focus on the right way of doing things from the tiniest of details such as the stroke of the arm, grips, and so forth;
    it often go into choking, costing their game
  + on programming, this is present when initially thinking about the algorithm without implementing a prototype yet
- to remedy against this: remember that [[id:df20e58b-6d38-4ace-8468-413bc708c772][Most of the work is done from smaller amount of effort]];
  additionally, you can [[id:01459b18-3f30-418e-bd8d-42661d5ea223][Start with wishful thinking]] instead of thinking about the process;
  this frees you from the details and think how would you directly solve the problem
  ideally, we would have the best course of action or the solution but usually, it is not realized nor tested against reality
