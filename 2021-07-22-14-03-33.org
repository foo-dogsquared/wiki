Repetition is simply rememebering, not understanding.
[[id:114b7874-6a20-49c8-be2c-46970c7110dc][Information is only acquired when you try to make sense of it]].

However, with the number of times we are doing, there are bounds to have mistakes.
[[id:e02e79be-c510-4382-ab85-d2384b502b20][Mistakes are where improvement occurs]].

[[id:c0e4fb0e-68f2-4db4-8c3e-f5a7845738c3][Understanding comes first from memory]].
This is where purposeful practice like [[id:9b669fd4-e04e-43dd-a61e-81dea5ec0764][Deliberate practice]] comes into play as we're lifting our skill level to be improved.
But not all repetition has to be useful either as [[id:864a9242-eb10-44ad-81b7-c237276523e5][We know more compared to what we understood]].
Sometimes, we practice repetition only to remember immediate information.
