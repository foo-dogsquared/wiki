Our brain is not good for storing ideas, only creating and jumping between them.

Like our emails, our writing inbox should be cleaned up each time we visit our inbox.
Not all of them are going to be important so feel free to remove entries that are not in need.
If you want to store an idea for an indefinite future (e.g., a project idea, future hobbies) that you cannot surely do now, you can then create a dedicated inbox.
